# APEX Framework
## AI-Powered Engineering eXperience — Enterprise SDLC Augmentation Plan
### Stack: Angular · Java · Spring Boot · Mainframe | Tools: Claude Code · GitHub Copilot

---

> **Platform Evolution — June 2026**
> APEX has grown beyond CLI/desktop augmentation into a full SDLC operating platform. The framework principles, governance model, and adoption strategy described in this document remain valid and are now enforced by the APEX Platform itself.
>
> **What's new:**
> - **`platform/`** — FastAPI backend + Next.js 14 frontend + PostgreSQL + Redis + Celery running as cloud-native containers (AWS ECS Fargate locally via Docker Compose)
> - **Live integrations** — GitHub, Jira, Rally, and Confluence are wired as live data sources (Celery background refresh), not just webhook triggers
> - **Flexible LLM layer** — Agents run on Anthropic, Ollama (local), Groq, or HuggingFace — switchable via `LLM_PROVIDER` env var with no code changes
> - **Per-phase AI agents** — autonomous agents for each SDLC phase generate artifacts, post to Jira/Confluence, review PRs, and enforce phase gates
> - **`portal-prototype/`** — the original static portal is retained as a reference; the live portal is `platform/frontend/`
>
> See [`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md) for the full 5-phase build plan and [`platform/CLAUDE.md`](../platform/CLAUDE.md) for the platform architecture.

## 1. Executive Summary

APEX is a non-intrusive AI augmentation layer that sits alongside your existing SDLC without replacing any tooling or ceremony. It routes the right AI capability to the right persona at the right stage of delivery — developers get Claude Code and Copilot in their IDEs, BAs and PMs get prompt-powered Confluence and Jira automation, testers get AI-generated test suites, and leadership gets AI-synthesized status reports.

**Core principles:**
- Zero new tools for non-engineering personas
- AI generates drafts; humans approve and commit
- Every AI action is logged, audited, and governed
- Adopt incrementally — one team, one sprint, one phase at a time

**Expected outcomes at 6 months:**
- 30–40% reduction in PR cycle time
- 50%+ reduction in boilerplate code authoring time
- 60% reduction in manual test case writing effort
- Near-zero undocumented COBOL programs (legacy modernisation)
- Consistent story quality scores across all squads

### 2.1 Key Design Decisions

**Claude Code vs GitHub Copilot — complementary, not competing**

| Capability | Claude Code | GitHub Copilot |
|---|---|---|
| Multi-file agentic edits | ✅ Primary | ❌ |
| Inline IDE autocomplete | Limited | ✅ Primary |
| Terminal / CLI workflow | ✅ Native | ❌ |
| PR description generation | ✅ | ✅ |
| COBOL / legacy analysis | ✅ Superior | Limited |
| M365 integration | ❌ | ✅ (Copilot M365) |
| Cost model | Usage-based API | Per-seat licence |

**Rule of thumb:** Copilot for keystrokes saved per minute; Claude Code for decisions made per hour.

---

## 3. What to Build vs What to Integrate

### 3.1 Integrate (Off-the-shelf — no custom build needed)

| Tool | Purpose | Persona |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code CLI | Agentic coding, refactoring, test gen | Developers, Testers |
| GitHub Copilot | IDE inline completion | Developers, Testers |
| Claude.ai Desktop / Web | Chat interface for non-devs | BA, PM, Coach, Stakeholder |
| GitHub Copilot M365 | Word, Excel, Outlook AI | PM, Stakeholder |
| GitHub Copilot for PR | PR description, review suggestions | Developers |
| Anthropic Claude API | Backend automation pipelines | Platform team |

### 3.2 Build (Custom — your differentiator)

#### A. CLAUDE.md Templates (Low effort, High ROI)
Per-repo context files that tell Claude Code your architecture, conventions, and constraints. One file per repo type:
- `CLAUDE.md` for Spring Boot microservices
- `CLAUDE.md` for Angular SPA
- `CLAUDE.md` for Mainframe COBOL batch
- `CLAUDE.md` for shared libraries

**What goes in a CLAUDE.md:**
```markdown
# Project Context
- Stack: Spring Boot 3.x, Java 21, PostgreSQL, Kafka
- Architecture: Hexagonal / Clean Architecture
- Naming: camelCase services, PascalCase DTOs
- Test framework: JUnit 5 + Mockito + Testcontainers
- Forbidden: no @Autowired on fields, no lombok @Data on entities
- API style: REST, OpenAPI 3.0, versioned under /api/v{n}/
- Package structure: .domain / .application / .infrastructure / .web
```

#### B. Prompt Library Portal (Medium effort)
A shared internal web page / Confluence space containing curated prompts per persona and ceremony. Developers paste once; non-devs click-to-copy.

**Prompt categories to build:**
- Sprint Planning: story refinement, estimation, dependency mapping
- Development: refactor patterns, migration stubs, DTO generation
- Testing: AC-to-test-case, API collection generation, edge case generator
- Review: PR summary, security checklist, OWASP scan prompt
- Reporting: sprint summary, exec dashboard, release notes
- COBOL: program explainer, JCL decoder, migration readiness assessment

#### C. Jira → Claude Automation Bridge (Medium effort)
A lightweight service (Python/Node) that:
1. Triggers on Jira webhook (sprint complete, ticket status change)
2. Calls Claude API with relevant Jira data
3. Writes output back to Confluence or creates a Jira comment

**Automations to build (priority order):**
1. Sprint End → Draft retrospective notes in Confluence
2. New Epic → Draft BRD template pre-populated with description
3. Bug closed → Auto-generate regression test stub in repo
4. Story "In Review" → Summarise PR diff in plain English for BA

#### D. CI/CD AI Gates (Medium-High effort)
GitHub Actions workflows that invoke Claude Code or Claude API at key pipeline stages:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ai-review.yml
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  ai-review:
    steps:
      - name: Claude Security Review
        run: claude --print "Review this diff for OWASP Top 10 issues" --diff
      - name: Generate PR Summary
        run: claude --print "Write a plain-English PR description"
      - name: Check test coverage delta
        run: claude --print "Identify untested methods in the diff"
```

**Gates to implement:**
- PR opened → AI security scan (non-blocking, advisory)
- PR opened → Auto-generate description if empty
- Merge to main → Update OpenAPI spec from code changes
- Release tag → Generate release notes from commit history

#### E. Governance Dashboard (Medium effort)
A web dashboard (React or simple HTML/JS) that shows:
- AI usage by team, persona, and week
- Prompt audit log (who asked what, when)
- Policy violations flagged
- Code acceptance rate (AI suggestions committed vs discarded)
- PII detection alerts

#### F. APEX Developer Portal (Low-Medium effort)
Single-page internal site that serves as the APEX home base:
- Getting started guide per persona (interactive)
- CLAUDE.md builder (form → generates context file)
- Prompt library browser
- Framework status and metrics
- Governance policy documentation

---

## 4. Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Phase 0 — Foundation (Weeks 1–2)

**Goal:** Install tools, establish baseline, no automation yet.

- [ ] Procure Claude Code licences (team plan) and GitHub Copilot Business seats
- [ ] Install Claude Code CLI on dev machines; verify `claude --version` in all IDEs
- [ ] Enable GitHub Copilot in IntelliJ IDEA and VS Code
- [ ] Draft AI Usage Policy v1 (see Section 7)
- [ ] Create `#ai-sdlc` Slack/Teams channel for sharing tips and issues
- [ ] Identify pilot squad (1 squad, ideally cross-functional)
- [ ] Baseline metrics: PR cycle time, bug escape rate, story points velocity

### Phase 1 — Developer Pilot (Weeks 3–6)

**Goal:** Prove value with developers first. Non-devs observe.

- [ ] Write `CLAUDE.md` for the pilot squad's primary repo (Spring Boot or Angular)
- [ ] Run a 2-hour Claude Code workshop: refactoring, test gen, PR review
- [ ] Run a 1-hour Copilot workshop: Angular component gen, Spring boilerplate
- [ ] Define daily check-in: "What did AI help you with today? What didn't work?"
- [ ] Collect Week 2 metrics vs baseline
- [ ] Publish `CLAUDE.md` templates to inner-source repo for other squads to adapt

### Phase 2 — BA, PM & QA Onboarding (Weeks 7–10)

**Goal:** Extend AI to non-dev personas with near-zero friction.

- [ ] Set up Claude.ai Desktop for BAs and PMs (Team plan)
- [ ] Build Prompt Library v1 in Confluence (10–15 prompts per persona)
- [ ] Run per-persona 90-min workshops:
  - BA: Story generation, gap analysis, BRD drafting
  - PM: Sprint report generation, risk summarisation
  - QA: AC-to-test-case, API test generation
  - Agile Coach: Retro synthesis, velocity report
- [ ] Deploy Jira → Claude automation #1 (sprint end → Confluence retro draft)
- [ ] Collect feedback, iterate prompt library

### Phase 3 — CI/CD & Automation (Weeks 11–14)

**Goal:** Bake AI into the pipeline so it's invisible but always working.

- [ ] Deploy AI PR review GitHub Action (security scan + description)
- [ ] Deploy release notes automation (tag → Claude → GitHub Release)
- [ ] Deploy OpenAPI spec auto-update on merge
- [ ] Enable Copilot for PR in GitHub settings
- [ ] Connect Jira automation bridge for 3 key triggers
- [ ] Set up APEX Governance Dashboard (basic version: log viewer + metrics)

### Phase 4 — Scale & Govern (Weeks 15–20)

**Goal:** All squads live; governance active; metrics proving ROI.

- [ ] Roll out to remaining squads with adapted `CLAUDE.md` per repo
- [ ] Launch APEX Developer Portal internally
- [ ] Activate PII Guard in governance layer
- [ ] Establish AI Review Board cadence (monthly)
- [ ] Publish APEX metrics to leadership dashboard
- [ ] Begin Mainframe modernisation track: COBOL analysis pipeline
- [ ] Retrospective: tune adoption, retire what isn't working

---

## 5. Rollout Strategy

### 5.1 Rollout Model: Concentric Rings

```
Ring 1 (Wk 1–6):   Pilot Squad — Devs only
Ring 2 (Wk 7–10):  Pilot Squad — Full cross-functional (BA, QA, PM)
Ring 3 (Wk 11–14): 2–3 additional squads — Devs + CI/CD automation
Ring 4 (Wk 15–20): All squads — Full APEX live
```

### 5.2 Change Management Approach

**Fear to address proactively:**

| Fear | Response |
|---|---|
| "AI will replace me" | Frame as: AI removes drudge work; you focus on higher-order thinking |
| "IP / code leaking to Anthropic" | Claude Code (API mode) does not train on your data; show the data policy |
| "AI generates wrong code" | Human reviews all AI output before commit; AI is a junior pair programmer |
| "Too much to learn" | Each persona gets exactly 3 prompts to start with. That's it. |

**Communication plan:**
- Week 0: Leadership briefing (30 min) — why, what, how measured
- Week 1: All-hands announcement — "AI tools pilot, not mandatory yet"
- Week 3: Pilot squad kickoff — hands-on, no slides
- Week 7: Demo day — pilot squad shows what worked
- Week 15: Org-wide launch — metrics-backed, wins highlighted

### 5.3 Non-Intrusive Design Rules

1. **AI never commits code** — it only suggests. Humans always have final control.
2. **AI never sends to Jira/Confluence automatically** — automations write drafts, humans publish.
3. **Opt-in initially** — no forced adoption in Phase 1 or 2. Mandate only in Phase 4 for CI/CD gates.
4. **Graceful degradation** — if Claude API is down, the pipeline continues; AI step skips with a warning.
5. **No prompt logging to external systems** — all audit logs stay in your infrastructure.

APEX Core Team (full-time)
    └── Squad AI Champions (one per squad, ~10% time)
            └── Persona leads (BA lead, QA lead, etc. — use the tools, share tips)
```

---

## 7. Governance Integration

### 7.1 AI Usage Policy (v1 Outline)

**Permitted uses:**
- Code generation, completion, and refactoring with human review
- Test case generation with human validation
- Documentation drafting with human approval
- Requirements and report drafting (non-binding until human approved)
- Summarisation of internal project data

**Prohibited uses:**
- Committing AI-generated code without human review
- Sending customer PII or production data to AI APIs
- Using AI output as the sole basis for architecture decisions
- Generating content that misrepresents AI as human-authored in external comms

**Licence considerations:**
- Claude Code: Output is not subject to Anthropic copyright claims (verify current ToS)
- GitHub Copilot: Copilot Business has IP indemnification — ensure Business tier is used

### 7.3 Governance Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Measured by |
|---|---|---|
| AI-assisted PR acceptance rate | > 70% | GitHub labels + merge data |
| Policy violations per month | < 5 | Audit log |
| PII detection blocks | 0 undetected leaks | PII guard alert log |
| AI usage coverage | > 80% of devs weekly | Claude Code telemetry |
| Human override rate | Tracked (no target) | PR review data |
| Model version currency | Within 1 major version | APEX config registry |

### 7.4 Integrating Governance into Existing Processes

**Sprint ceremonies:**
- Sprint planning: AI-generated stories marked `[AI-Draft]` until BA approves
- Sprint review: AI sprint summary presented, PM confirms before stakeholder send
- Retro: AI-synthesised retro notes are a starting point, coach facilitates discussion

**Change management:**
- All CLAUDE.md changes go through PR review by Tech Lead
- Prompt library changes reviewed by AI Platform Engineer before publish
- New automation triggers require AI Review Board approval
